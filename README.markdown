m3d
===

m3d is a small but quite functional library for visualization of a 3D space which is filled
with lines, rectangles, triangles and 'markers'.

When you want to visualize something special, which is not covered by the options of hard-coded layouts.

There is also possibility to draw a text using any available font in this space. Text in this case will
be converted in a set of 3D lines.

Slso all above is quite useful to visualize some economic or scientific information.

Actually I've wrote this library to visualize distribution of performance and response time
dependencies of the multiuser automatic performance testing.
